Oblivion<br>Oblivion
Meet Mr City Dweller.
He accumulates a lot of wealth But do not forget to ask him about his mental health.
He owns diamonds that shine But why does he continue to whine?
He has many a thing to flaunt But there is something that continues to haunt.
His boss, friends and family are impressed But why on earth is he so depressed?
His mission is to build a flawless humanoid But will that make him any less paranoid?
He lives in a high-end flat But there is no end to the combat.
He owns the most expensive car Yet he wants to isolate himself somewhere far.
He seeks solace in an alcoholic drink But does that throbbing pain actually shrink?
He lives a life so lavish But some day his pains along with his body shall vanish.
Yet he runs after things so ephemeral Oblivious of his position that is eternal.
