Cancer has snatched the lives of innumerable innocent souls.
Rose remembers her grandmom who succumbed to cancer decades back.
Never had she imagined that she would be next in queue.
As Rose lay down tearily, she thought of the symptoms she ignored:
abnormal bleeding, prolonged cough, weight loss
oh, and that lump on her back!

when she was depressed.
She was an addict, like her father, who too was depressed.
Now she couldn't be more repentant.

but it only seemed to haunt her more.
